# Integrating icloud  calendar into Gnome Calendar

While I am still using my hackintosh a lot, I still wanted to use Linux more and more. One thin I noticed when setting up my pop os install further, was that while Google Calendar is well integrated, there is no direct integration for icloud calendars.

It turns out, the easiest way to add those and the address book, is to install the evolution groupware client, and then add a "collection account" for icloud. For this to work, you would also have to set up an app-specific password at https://appleid.apple.com/
